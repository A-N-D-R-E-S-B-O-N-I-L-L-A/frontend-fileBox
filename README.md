# fileBox

file box app is an application very similar to google drive or dropbox, since it will allow you to upload files to the cloud. fileBox brings all the tools a cloud storage app needs, so feel free to give it a try.
The application is a free application made without profit, therefore it is possible that the storage is very limited or that even some of your files are periodically deleted, any doubt, suggestion, criticism, etc. that you have about the project, tell me on my social networks and there I will try to assist you as soon as possible.
